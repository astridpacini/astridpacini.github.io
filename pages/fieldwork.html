<p><H3><a href="https://calypsodri.whoi.edu/">Calypso</a>: Coherent Lagrangian Pathways from the Surface Ocean to Interio</H3></p>
<p> As a participant in the Calypso project, I study the three dimensional pathways that transport biological and biogeochemical tracers including phytoplankton, nutrients, oxygen, and carbon. At sea, I lead sampling of the biological community structure through optical measurements, flow cytometry, 16S sequencing, and respiration rate measurements. </p>
