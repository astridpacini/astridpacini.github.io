<p> My research focuses on ocean processes at high latitudes. I am particularly interested in boundary current dynamics, boundary current-interior interactions, and water mass transformation. These processes influence the climate at a range of spatio-temporal scales, impacting local weather, global climate, local and remote fisheries, sea level rise, oceanic heat uptake, carbon sequestration, and a whole host of critical climate processes. We must understand how our high latitude oceans work presently, in order to understand how they will change in the future.<p>
