<p> My research focuses on ocean processes at high latitudes, which influence climate locally and globally. I am an observational physical oceanographer particularly interested in boundary current dynamics and water mass transformation. I study these dynamics using a range of in-situ tools including mooring data, hydrographic surveys, dirfters and floats, as well as satellite products, reanalysis datasets, and simple process models. We must understand how our high latitude oceans work presently, in order to understand how they will change in the future.</p>

    <p> I am interested in the structure, variability, and dynamics of the boundary currents of the subpolar gyre. This cyclonic circulation transport heat and freshwater around the basin, and these properties influence boundary current transport and offshore property fluxes. If, how, and when these waters are fluxed offshore, they can influence ventilation and the formation of the lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The dominant processes dictating the structure of these boundary currents remain unresolved, due to poor data coverage in the region. I seek to characterize the boundary current system across a range of spatio-temporal scales by coupling newly-available observations along with remote-sensing data and reanalysis output. </p>

    <p> I study water mass transformaiton in the Pacific Arctic, and how atmosphere-ocean and ice-ocean interactions influence these dynamics. This has implications for biological productivity in the region, as well as the ventilation of the Arctic halocline. This has included characterizing the role of ice formation and brine rejection and convection, the role of wind on mixed layer development and aerosolization of surface waters, and the role of a loitering ice edge on near-surface stratification. </p>
