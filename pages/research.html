<p> My research focuses on ocean processes at high latitudes. I am an observational physical oceanographer particularly interested in boundary current dynamics, boundary current-interior interactions, and water mass transformation. I study these dynamics using a range of in-situ tools including mooring data, hydrographic surveys, dirfters and floats, as well as satellite products, reanalysis datasets, and simple process models. These processes influence the climate at a range of spatio-temporal scales, impacting local weather, global climate, fisheries, sea level rise, oceanic heat uptake, carbon sequestration, and a whole host of critical climate processes. We must understand how our high latitude oceans work presently, in order to understand how they will change in the future.</p>

    <p> I am interested in the structure, variability, and dynamics of the boundary currents of the subpolar gyre. These circulation patterns transport heat and fershwater around the basin, and these properties can have important implications for boundary current transport as well as offshore property fluxes to the interior basins. If, how, and when these waters are fluxed offshore, they can influence ventilation and the formation of the lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The dominant processes dictating the structure of these boundary currents remain unresolved, due to poor data coverage in the region. I seek to characterize the boundary current system across a range of spatio-temporal scales by coupling newly-available observations along with remote-sensing data and reanalysis output. </p>

    <p> I study water mass transformaiton in the Pacific Arctic, and how atmosphere-ocean and ice-ocean interactions influence these dynamics. This has implications for biological productivity in the region, as well as the ventilation of the Arctic halocline. </p>
