<p> My research focuses on ocean processes at high latitudes. I am particularly interested in boundary current dynamics, boundary current-interior dynamics, and water mass transformation. My work focuses on the physical oceanography of the polar and subpolar seas, and the implications of these dynamics for climate variability. <p>
