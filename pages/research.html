<p> My research focuses on ocean processes at high latitudes. I am particularly interested in boundary current dynamics, boundary current-interior interactions, and water mass transformation. These processes influence the climate at a range of spatio-temporal scales, impacting local weather, global climate, local and remote fisheries, sea level rise, oceanic heat uptake, carbon sequestration, and a whole host of critical climate processes. We must understand how our high latitude oceans work presently, in order to understand how they will change in the future.</p>

    <p> I am interested in the structure, variability, and dynamics of the boundary currents of the subpolar gyre. The dominant processes dictating the structure of these boundary currents remain unresolved, due to poor data coverage as a result of challenging working conditions in the region and a small deformation radius. I seek to characterize the boundary current system across a range of spatio-temporal scales. </p>

    <p> I study water mass transformaiton in the Pacific Arctic, and how atmosphere-ocean and ice-ocean interactions modify the properties of these waters. This has implications for biological productivity in the region. </p>
