The cyclonic boundary current that circumnavigates the Labrador Sea plays an important role in modulating the strength of wintertime convection in the interior basin, as well as restratifying the newly ventilated water in spring. Modeling studies indicate that meso and sub-mesoscale processes in the boundary current flux a significant amount of heat and freshwater offshore, although observations of this small-scale variability are lacking. Using four years of data from a mooring array west of Cape Farewell, Greenland, together with satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature measurements, we present the first observations of a meandering West Greenland current. We describe the statistics, structure, characteristics, and formation mechanism of these features. The meanders occur roughly 30% of the time and are more prevalent in winter and early spring, with an increasing trend over the four-year record. It is shown that baroclinic instability of the boundary current is the cause of the meanders, triggered by seasonal steepening of the ispoycnals between the interior basin and the boundary due to convection. We argue that the meandering leads to the formation of small-scale eddies, and estimate the resulting offshore heat flux. Finally, possible connections between the meanders and the production of Irminger Rings are explored.
