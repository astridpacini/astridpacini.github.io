    The cyclonic boundary current system in the Labrador Sea regulates the strength of convection and restratification in the interior basin through shelf-basin exchange. In this study, we use four years of high-resolution mooring measurements in the West Greenland boundary current system to characterize the presence of mesoscale variability and to understand how this variability facilitates offshore fluxes of properties. Two types of variability are identified: mid-depth intensified cyclonic eddies, and meanders of the West Greenland Current. The cyclones are generated upstream by vortex stretching at Denmark Strait (known as Denmark Strait Overflow Cyclones) and significantly increase the transport of overflow waters in the boundary current. The meanders are triggered by seasonal baroclinic instability, leading to the formation of small-scale boundary current eddies. These small-scale features can flux heat offshore and are shown, to first order, to balance the wintertime heat loss in the interior basin. This is the first observational evidence of these two mesoscale processes in the West Greenland Current.
