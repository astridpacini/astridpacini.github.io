    The cyclonic boundary current system in the Labrador Sea regulates the strength of convection and restratification in the interior basin through shelf-basin exchange. In this study, we use four years of high-resolution mooring measurements in the West Greenland boundary current system to characterize the presence of mesoscale variability and to understand how this variability facilitates offshore fluxes of properties. Two types of variability are identified: mid-depth intensified cyclonic eddies, and meanders of the West Greenland Current. The cyclones are generated upstream by vortex stretching at Denmark Strait (known as Denmark Strait Overflow Cyclones) and significantly increase the transport of overflow waters in the boundary current. The meanders are triggered by seasonal baroclinic instability, leading to the formation of small-scale boundary current eddies. These small-scale features can flux heat offshore and are shown, to first order, to balance the wintertime heat loss in the interior basin. This is the first observational evidence of these two mesoscale processes in the West Greenland Current.

The cyclonic boundary current that circumnavigates the Labrador Sea plays an important role in modulating the strength of wintertime convection in the interior basin, as well as restratifying the newly ventilated water in spring. Modeling studies indicate that meso and sub-mesoscale processes in the boundary current flux a significant amount of heat and freshwater offshore, although observations of this small-scale variability are lacking. Using four years of data from a mooring array west of Cape Farewell, Greenland, together with satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature measurements, we present the first observations of a meandering West Greenland current. We describe the statistics, structure, characteristics, and formation mechanism of these features. The meanders occur roughly 30% of the time and are more prevalent in winter and early spring, with an increasing trend over the four-year record. It is shown that baroclinic instability of the boundary current is the cause of the meanders, triggered by seasonal steepening of the ispoycnals between the interior basin and the boundary due to convection. We argue that the meandering leads to the formation of small-scale eddies, and estimate the resulting offshore heat flux. Finally, possible connections between the meanders and the production of Irminger Rings are explored.
