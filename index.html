      <p>I study the ways that physical oceanographic processes affect ocean microbial ecology, carbon cycling, and nutrient distributions. I use a range of methods in my work from numerical ocean models to observational work at sea. My work understanding the link between biological and physical processes involves developing methodologies for modeling ecological processes in the context of environmental variability. </p>
