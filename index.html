      <p>I study physical oceanography and ocean microbial ecology â€“ the distribution and diversity of microorganisms in the ocean, where microbes make up the majority of the primary production. I use a range of methods in my work from numerical ocean models to observational work at sea. My work understanding the link between biological and physical processes involves developing methodologies for modeling ecological processes in the context of environmental variability. </p>
