      <p> I am an observational physical oceanographer. I study processes at high latitudes, including ice-ocean interactions, boundary current dynamics, and watermass transformation. Understanding how these regions work presently is critical to understanding how our high latitude oceans will change in the future.</p>

      <p> I am an NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory, working with <a href="https://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Steele&first_name=Mike" target = "_blank">Dr Mike Steele</a>. I received my PhD from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography, where I worked with <a href="https://rpickart.whoi.edu/" target = "_blank">Dr Bob Pickart. </p>
